Arionum-Java
------------------
Arionum is a pretty new cryptocurrency that's largely CPU bound, resisting ASIC and GPU optimizations. This is a perfect coin to mine for people with GPU hardware doing other mining but low utilization of CPU resources.

It caught my eye and as part of code-vetting I figured I might as well do a port to Java and see if I can get some more efficiency out of the code or better interfacing. I'll try as I'm able (pretty rusty with PHP) to also contribute back to the PHP reference implementations.
